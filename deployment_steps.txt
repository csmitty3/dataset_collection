The following are steps I will take to deployment:

1) Turn my deep learning model to a pickle.
2) Convert my code from a jupyter notebook to a true python script.
3) Use Docker to containerize my project.
4) Use Flask to create a web application.
5) Add a front end with HTML/CSS/Javascript.
6) Deploy website using Heroku.
